# SafeBrowse Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2026

SafeBrowse is a browser extension designed to protect users from malicious and phishing websites using server-side threat intelligence. We take user privacy seriously and minimize data collection to what is strictly necessary for security purposes.

## Information We Collect

SafeBrowse processes website URLs that a user attempts to visit in order to determine whether a site may be malicious or unsafe.

We do NOT collect:
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Names, email addresses, or account information
- Passwords or authentication credentials
- Financial or payment information
- Personal communications
- Health or location data

## How Information Is Used

Visited URLs are sent securely to a threat-analysis service solely to assess whether a website poses a security risk.  
URLs are analyzed only for safety determination and are not used for advertising, tracking, or profiling.

## Data Storage

SafeBrowse may store limited local preferences (such as user allow-lists) using the browser’s local storage.  
No browsing history is permanently stored on external servers.

## Data Sharing

SafeBrowse does not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties except as required to perform threat analysis.

## Remote Code and Services

SafeBrowse uses a remote threat analysis service hosted on Cloudflare Workers to evaluate potentially malicious URLs.  
No executable code is downloaded or executed remotely in the user’s browser.

## User Control

Users may:
- Temporarily bypass a warning
- Permanently allow specific domains
- Disable or remove the extension at any time
